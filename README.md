This is a Tensorflow implementation of my optimization algorithm for ML models called Ran optimizer
This algorithm uses some aspects from random search alggorithm and traditional gradient decent algorithms

Here, a tensorflow model is trained on a number dataset

this repo contains functionality to train the model using ran optimizer as well as traditional adam optimizer. training loss can also be plotted

To get started just run main.py file
  note: for first time we need to bake dataset first, but this is automatically done by main.py file
